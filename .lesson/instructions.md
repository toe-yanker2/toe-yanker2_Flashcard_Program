# Project #3 Make Some Flash Cards

## Requirements

Create 20 flashcards. Each card has:
* a text prompt that will be displayed to the user
* a correct answer that can by typed in
  
Show the flashcards in a random order
* get user's response
* check if the response is correct

Use file I/O to keep track of user performance, e.g.
* How many questions did the user get right vs wrong
* Which questions did the user get right vs wrong
* Use the user input data (performance or other text input) to change the way you show the flashcards. You only have to choose one way to respond to user performance. Here are some suggestions:
* Show flashcards that a user got wrong more frequently than the ones they got right
* Stop showing a flashcard once the user gets it right a certain number of times
* Implement the The Leitner System
* Let the user answer questions about how many flashcards they want to see, or which flashcards they want to see more frequently
* Let the user choose from different flashcard decks
* Let the user choose how many times they want to see each flash card, or what difficulty they want

Extra credit options:
* Have an option to display statistics on user performance.
* Allow a user to "login" with a specific username, so different people can use your system and keep track of their results separately.
* EXTRA-extra-credit option: make a visual interface. Try exploring tkinter.
